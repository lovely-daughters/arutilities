probably going to have black and white. most of background is white. + hair is very prominently white. there's the back of the hair in shade which is darker, which will likely be separated into a separate color. eyes will be mapped to black probably. 
black will be matted out due to the back of hair being a huge chunk of gray. 

these are the main predictions going into this time to see if they're correct. 

main thing was clothing getting mapped to black. i guess the white is really bright so it one centroid would be pulled far as fuck away. 

line that wavers in intensity throughout due to pen pressure leads to breaks. 

adding a third color will probably separate blacks.
actually there are more white/gray pixels. wouldn't be surprised. 
more white so white probably separates further. hair got mapped to black, but wouldn't be surprised if it's close. 

yeah white separated further. more like gray than black.
anyhow, interesting to see how much line quality suffers if it's not a consistent color. visually there's no issue whatsoever as it's very easily interpretable and readable. 

linework is good after 5. connected and continuous even if value isn't. easily interpretable as one thing. 

interesting to note how eye color is left out. the cluster has too few datapoints and doesn't provide enough pull towards it. 

going to try a more realistic image next.
